Trying to make my own music bot and learn python

This bot is for personal use I will not be giving any invites if someone asks (maybe in future)

If you wanna see your command in my bot, make new issue and set `title:/[command name]` and `description:[what will this command do]`

Made in python, using hikari and lightbulb module
